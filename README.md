# Meme Generator

Hi there! This is a sample typescript React app utilising the [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api) to fetch meme templates and generate memes.
It uses the following techniques and libraries:

- Code splitting with React lazy and Suspense
- React query v5 for data fetching integrating with Suspense
- Error boundary (react-error-boundary) with fallback and reset
- Lazy loading images on the home page (react-intersection-observer)
- Custom hooks to extract logic from a component
- Dynamic refs and ref forwarding
- React Context with memoization
- React router v6.16
- Material UI / styled component using the styled() utility with custom props
- Custom caption positioning with react-moveable
